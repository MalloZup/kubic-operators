# Configuration

The Dex operator can configure [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) automatically from a
set of Custom Resources. From Dex's documentation:

> Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps.
> Dex acts as a portal to other identity providers through "connectors." This lets Dex defer
> authentication to LDAP servers, SAML providers, or established identity providers like
> GitHub, Google, and Active Directory. Clients write their authentication logic once
> to talk to Dex, then Dex handles the protocols for a given backend.
